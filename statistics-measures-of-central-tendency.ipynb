    "> **Tip:** A good way to wrap your head around growth rate and compounding is to determine the doubling time i.e. the number of periods it takes for a number to double. Here's a shorthand, if a number is growing at a rate of $r%$, then it takes approximately $72/r$ periods to double. E.g. If the number of registered users on Jovian grows by $12%$ on average, then the number will double ever 6 months. Can you prove this relationship?\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of the topics covered in this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average / Arithmetic Mean\n",
    "  - The average or arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the how many numbers are being averaged. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\\textrm{Average} = \\frac{\\textrm{Sum of values}}{\\textrm{Number of values}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Sometimes you may need to apply a weight to each number. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\\textrm{Weighted Average} = \\frac{\\textrm{Weighted sum of values}}{\\textrm{Sum of weights}}$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Average/mean is susceptible to outliers (the **Michael Jordan** effect) and may not be a good measure of central tendency in such cases.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vgG29mb.png\" width=\"640\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Median and Percentile\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UPiZkuE.png\" width=\"640\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* The median of a set of numbers is the *middle number* of the set, after the numbers have been arranged in increasing order. E.g. the median of the numbers $3, 7, 10, 55, 97$ is $10$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the size of the set is even, there's no single middle number. In this case, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. E.g. the median of $3, 5, 21, 33, 42, 300$ is $(21 + 33)/2 = 27$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A percentile is the generalization of median. The K-th percentile is a number equal to or larger than K % of the values in the set. The median is the 50-th percentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quartiles and Range\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quartile are numbers that divide a dataset into 4 equal parts (or quarters). A dataset has three quartiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **1st Quartile or Q1**: 25% of values lie below it i.e. it's the 25th percentile\n",
    "  2. **2nd Quartile or Q2**: 50% of values lie below it i.e. it's the median or 50th percentile\n",
    "  3. **3rd Quartile or Q3**: 75% of values lie below it i.e. it's the 75th percentile\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SQXnns4.png\" width=\"360\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* Range of a set of numbers is defined by two values: the minimum and the maximum. Ranges and quartiles are often used together to get a sense of the spread and distribution of values in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The range and quartiles of a set of numbers are often plotted using a \"box-and-whiskers\" plot (sometimes just called a box plot).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/vB42RrG.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mode and Frequency Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "* The mode of a set of values is simply the most frequently occurring value in the set. E.g. the mode of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8]` is `4` because it occurs more times than any other value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there isn't a single value that occurs most frequently, all the values are occur most frequently are modes. The data is said to be *multimodal* in such cases. E.g. The set `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 4]` has two modes, `1` and `4`, which both occur twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unlike mean and median, mode is not limited to numbers, it is defined for any set of values. The mode of the set of values `['red', 'green', 'blue', 'green', 'red', 'green', 'green']` is `'green'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A frequency table shows how many times each observation occurs in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MeRJqAg.png\" width=\"240\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skewness of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Skewness, in statistics, is the degree of asymmetry observed in a set of observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The relative order of mean, median and mode indicates the direction of skewness in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/0*wHMvuwRa_YF9SFwY.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance and Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **variance** of a set of numbers measures how far each number is from the mean of the set. It is denoted by the symbol $\\sigma^2$ (pronounced \"sigma squared\") and is defined by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\sigma^2 = \\frac{ (x_1 - \\mu)^2 + (x_2 - \\mu)^2 + ... + (x_n - \\mu)^2 }{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\textrm{Variance} = \\frac{\\textrm{Sum of squares of difference between observations and mean}} {\\textrm{Number of observations}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **standard deviation** of a set of numbers is defined as the square root of the variance. It is denoted by the symbol $\\sigma$ (pronounced \"sigma\") and is defined by the formula\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\sigma^2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{ (x_1 - \\mu)^2 + (x_2 - \\mu)^2 + ... + (x_n - \\mu)^2 }{n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\textrm{ Standard Deviation } = \\sqrt{\\textrm{ Variance }}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Growth and Average Growth Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "* Growth in any period is defined the percentage increase in the number since the previous period:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{Growth} =  \\frac{\\textrm{Current Value} - \\textrm{Previous Value}} {\\textrm{Previous Value}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Average Growth Rate is the percentage of growth, when applied across all periods, results in the same final number. It is given by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\textrm{Average Growth} = r = \\sqrt[n]{(1+r_1)(1+r_2)...(1+r_n)} - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Projecting growth forward can help us estimate numbers in the future. If the average growth rate is $r$ and the number is $N$, the number $k$ periods later is given by:\n",
